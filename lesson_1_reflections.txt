How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Diff shows differences between two version of a file. If the first version
	was functioning properly and the other not, we can see and try if the bug
	was introduced with this difference.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can see different versions of a program and easy make decisions which
	versions was better.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can simply forget to save, on the other hand you can save a file in the
	moment you find resonable.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Documents are rarely bound together, where files of a program are.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    See different commits and see the difference between them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back to a point where everything was OK.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Version control of programs, first exercise for a job!

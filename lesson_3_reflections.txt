When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   When I work on several different computers or collaborate with other people.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   Some commits are not ready to be public, you can then decide by your own, which version is ready to be show to the others.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
   Fork creates a copy of someones repo, clone is a local copy of a repository and branch is a mechanism, allowing to create
   several different versions of the same repo. 1st when I want to have someones repo, but don't have permissions to edit it,
   2nd when I want to make changes to a repo on my own computer and 3rd when I want to make some experimental changes.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
   You can then track changes, that were made while you were offline.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
   Using Google Drive or Dropbox or Microsoft Office collaboration feature. Everything would be harder, except it would
   be less steps necessary in order to make a change.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
   Different branch - experimental change, needed to be aproved by other collaborators. It's good for having official, working
   version and the one to make new features, that do not always work correctly.
